            <h2>Whispers of Discontent</h2>
            <p>
               The class of 2019&#39;s first 2 years on Howard&#39;s campus were revealing. Coming in expecting a space where our voices would be prioritized and culture celebrated,
               being thrown to the wolves of the corporate university model felt like betrayal. We applied thinking Howard University was interested in developing
               activist-scholars to aid in movement post-Ferguson. Instead, we entered corporate and federal employment funnels. Of course, the rebels began to organize themselves.
            </p>

            <h2>The Purges</h2>
            <p>
               Every freshman class at Howard University is quickly inducted into a long-inherited tradition of elitism. Like most colleges. Our particular ritual occurs like this: <br />
               At some orientation-type of meeting, the speaker begins, &#34;Look to your left.&#34; After a beat, &#34;Now, look to your right. Only one of you is going have what it takes to-&#34;
               and all that gross demotivational jazz. Sadly, no lies were told. I made friends who just didn&#39;t make it back after Winter Break freshman year. Some cool folks did not come
               back sophomore year. Members of the queer advocacy organization spoke of constantly fighting financial aid, the counseling center, and struggling for accommodations.

            <h2>Gentrification and the Student Housing Crisis</h2>
            <p>
               While effectively kicking out their own student population, Howard was also looking to make some land development decisions to recoup the usual American curse of Black
               financial hardship. Booting students graduated to ceding historic Black-owned land to corporate developers. These developers unfailingly announced plans for luxury
               apartments on every plot. Including the old dorms Howard had neglected...leading to a housing shortage for the remaining students. #HomelessAtHoward went viral on Twitter.
               And the homeless encampments in the Shaw-Howard neighborhood of DC started getting more frequent and aggressive sweeps from Metro PD, preparing the poor-less view for
               the promised incoming/encroaching yuppies. The historic neighborhood was less and less recognizable. The Black neighbors, fewer and fewer. We saw the parallels in our studies
               of our history--We are still disallowed Home here.

            <h2>Douglass Hall Goes Kaput</h2><img src="images\DougLESShall.jpg" id="douglassDarty">
            <p>
               The oldest, most historical building on campus; yes, the building holding my major department&#39;s offices, of course, burst many pipes over a particularly cold
               winter break junior year. All my possible mentors were scattered to disparate places on campus. The arts and sciences building would be the one to receive no investment.
               The pesky radicals hide in there, and bring no deep sponsorship pockets like School of Business&#39;s financier connections or School of Engineering&#39;s arms developer
               connections. Another deep strike to our collective faith in the University.
            </p>

            <h2>James Comey is not Our Homie</h2>
            <p>
               A group formed of radical students who&#39;d done organizing against campus police and rape culture, and combined with students studying queerness and revolutionary
               politics. Many of these students were studying in the Africana tradition, having gone on trips to Cuba, Haiti, Egypt, and [Zionist-occupied] Palestine, and studying
               abroad in Senegal, Ghana, and Japan. Some of us just grew up poor and weird and isolated. Whatever the case, after all that was already going on, HUResist burst
               onto the scene to protest an honored lecture series from former FBI Director James Comey to Howard's politics related disciplines. We planned in advance, wore all Black,
               made the news for yelling &#34;F*ck James Comey; You're not our homie!&#34; (we had a lull in good political chants and one of our people went creatively rogue. We backed him
               up and the crowd went completely cold on us). James Comey did not finish that first lecture, and we sparked a much needed conversation about Howard&#39;s history of selling
               out activists. I also definitely have a Secret Service file, at the least.

            <h2>Trump&#39;s Plantation: Devos?!</h2>
            <p>
               Not officially HUResist, but maybe some affiliates, decided to voice frustration at the accumulated slights against the Black collective by &#39;our own&#39;
               university. We woke up to news headlines announcing that white supremacist Secretary of Education under Trump, Betsy Devos, had hosted a meeting of the University Board
               and the President. Students had been kept completely unaware, and felt yet more betrayal. We were learning too fast and too often that we could not escape white supremacy
               and its control over &#39;our&#39; institutions in this country.

               She was literally making legal moves to help shut down public schools and propagate the class-stratified charter
               school system. We wanted her to have no part in decisions about our education. Alas, because Howard receives public funds, she was a de facto member of the Board of
               Trustees.

            <h2>THEE ILLUSTRIOUS Financial Aid Scandal</h2>
            <p>
               This was in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/howard-university-student-accused-of-stealing-429000-in-financial-aid-buying-fancy-clothes">news big-time</a>!
               HUResist got a heads-up that the story was about to drop while we were already planning the A-Building Takeover. We got a huge influx of student support once the larger
               body found out and the entire story went viral on Twitter. We knew then that we were going to succeed for sure.

            <h2>Creating the Kwame Ture Student Center</h2>
            <p>
               The takeover took weeks to plan. I actually came up with the physical, phased gameplan myself. HUResist set up a decoy rally that was also delivering connected info
               about internationalism and local struggles to connect the students&#39; grievances to. Meanwhile, HUResist members coordinated leading inconspicuous waves of students into
               the building. By the time campus police realized something was amiss, all the beginner waves were milling on the three accessible floors, and the rally was being led
               across the Yard and to Administration. After a short little skirmish at the doors, maybe 15 minutes, I heard the yells of &#34;Student Power!&#34; ringing into the basement
               level. From there, we created a vibrant student community space while holding the administration hostage with our demands and negotiations. We hosted teach-ins, a
               stroll-off, food donations, guest lecturers, and panels of all sorts. We renamed it the Kwame Ture Student Center, in honor of our Pan-Africanist organizer inspiration
               and alumna.

            <h2>Epilogue: Most for Naught</h2>
            <p>
               We made mistakes, but the most critical mistake we made, was leaving the building before clinching our most powerful demand: the resignation of the university
               President, Wayne A. I. Frederick (pictured here with the late and great Chadwick Boseman, rest in power), and the implementation of student democracy in university
               decisions.

               We got agreements for a funded pantry, student housing reforms, and a bunch of other stuff that was rolled back within two years. Without people power, all concessions
               are temporary. The organizers of HUResist learned so much with this defeat. There is still plenty to analyze. Still plenty to do.
